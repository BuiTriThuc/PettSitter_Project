                Many people still believe that the difference between humans and
                pets is largely due to emotions. They think that pets like dogs
                and cats have no feelings, but in fact, this is completely
                wrong. As everyone knows, dogs are pets that have been
                domesticated by humans for a long time, they have lived with
                humans for a long time, so they always tend to want to be closer
                to their owners. They have feelings, they also know how to
                distinguish between friends and enemies and of course they can
                also be "Shocked" when they encounter something. Such “shocks”
                can cause long-lasting depression that is difficult to treat

                Pets are often very sensitive to the change of the living
                environment, such as when they move to a new home or when the
                house appears a new member. At times like this, our pet will
                often have some shock signs, often they will become
                uncomfortable or bite and sad. There are even some cases, pets
                may vomit, skin rash, diarrhea, stop eating or appetite.

                  Added or lost a family member: The most common case is that
                  the owner no longer spends much time with them due to being
                  too busy. According to statistics in the UK, an average of 1
                  in 4 pets suffers from psychological problems because the
                  owner often goes to work and does not spend much time with
                  them. In addition, when the owner's mood is too stressed or
                  stressed, their pets is also affected.

                  Age-related depression: As your pets gets older, your pets may
                  experience some decline in functional functions such as
                  eating, limping, blurred vision, etc. Because these are
                  important activities that affect quality. Life, so our pets is
                  very susceptible to depression because it can no longer
                  maintain the same rhythm of life as before.

                <li>
                  Weather-related depression: If you live in areas with extreme
                  weather conditions, your pets is more likely to become
                  depressed if the weather changes for the worse.

                  6 Proven Ways to Calm Your Anxious pets
                </h3>
                <h5 class="small-title">1. Exercise Your Pets</h5>
                <div class="padding-p-relax">
                  <p>
                    If your pets has separation anxiety, the obvious way to ease
                    their mind is to never leave them alone. That is not a
                    reality for most pet owners, so using exercise as both a
                    bonding time and to tire out your pet is often an easy fix!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because anxiety can cause an excess of energy, taking your
                    pets out to play ball or on a long walk before you leave can
                    be helpful. Providing plenty of physical contacts and
                    talking to them during this time is also beneficial. And,
                    like their human counterparts, exercise can help relieve
                    stress by producing beneficial endorphins.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <h5 class="small-title">2. Physical Contact</h5>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">
                  There is probably nothing more soothing to anxious pets than
                  their owner’s touch. Try to identify the signs of anxiety in
                  your pets and nip them in the bud as early as possible by
                  picking them up, cuddling on the couch, or giving them a good
                  long petting session.
                </p>
                <h5 class="small-title">3. Massage</h5>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">
                  As you probably know, a massage will relax and calm even the
                  most anxious human — did you know it also works wonders with
                  pets as well?! Anxiety often causes tensing of the muscles and
                  massage therapy is one way to alleviate tension. Start at the
                  neck and work downward with long strokes. Try to keep one hand
                  on the pets, while the other works to massage. Over time you
                  may even be able to identify where your pets hold their stress
                  and just work on that one particular area.
                </p>
                <h5 class="small-title">4. Music Therapy</h5>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">
                  Music therapy has been proven to be beneficial for both
                  humans, as well as our canine and feline friends. The power of
                  music can be calming and relaxing while you’re home, in the
                  car, or away from your pet. Music can also alleviate noise
                  sensitivity by blocking the street or scary noises that
                  bothersome pets and create anxiety.

                <p class="padding-p-relax">
                  Research has shown that many pets prefer classical music. Harp
                  music, often used in hospice situations, can be a natural
                  sedative. You might try:

                <p class="padding-p-relax">
                  While anxiety isn’t a bad behavior per se, it can help to give
                  your pets some time-out when they’re acting out. Isolating
                  your pet in a safe and quiet space can help calm their frayed
                  nerves. Maybe that space has some very quiet music playing,
                  low lights, and/or some aromatherapy available
                </p>
                <h5 class="small-title">6. Alternative Therapies</h5>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">
                  While there is limited evidence that alternative products can
                  be of benefit to dogs suffering from anxiety, the products
                  listed below are non-invasive and will cause no harm. They are
                  therapies that can be used alone or combined with those above
                  to be more effective. Be sure to do proper research before
                  implementing alternative therapies, and consult with your
                  veterinarian, too.

                <h6 class="small-title">Rescue Remedy for Pets</h6>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">
                  Rescue Remedy is part of the Bach homeopathic line of remedies
                  for humans. Homeopathy was founded over 200 years ago and is
                  popular in Europe and England. (The Queen even has her own
                  Royal Homepath.) It is based on the principle of similarity
                  and uses plants and flower in all remedies.
                </p>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">
                  Rescue Remedy Pet is comprised of 5 different Bach Flower
                  Remedies that constitute a stress reliever. It is completely
                  safe to use on your dog. You just add 2-4 drops directly to
                  their drinking water. There is also a spray that you can use
                  on pet bedding and toys.
                </p>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">
                  Note: There are other homeopathic remedies that can be used on
                  pets for specific issues, like constant barking, intolerance
                  toward strangers, or loss of an owner.
                </p>
                <h6 class="small-title">Supplements</h6>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">
                  There are dog treats that contain helpful supplements proven
                  to help anxiety. Typically they will contain melatonin,
                  thiamin, chamomile, L-Theanine or L-tryptophan. Some also have
                  a ginger element to help with sensitive stomachs. These are
                  often recommended for general and travel anxiety.
